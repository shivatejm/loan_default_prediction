Data set we chose for our project is “predicting loan risk”. Link:https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/credit-risk-modelling-eda-classification
The goal of our project is to identify whether a person will full pay back the loan(1) or will be a defaulter(0). The number of data points we had in the loan data which had 887379 rows containing 75 features for each row. The output variable in the original was loan status which contained different names like Fully Paid, Default, No info, Charged Off. We converted the loan status outcome to a new binary variable called loan_outcome which only takes the value “0” or “1”.
